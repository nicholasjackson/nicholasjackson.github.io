EE have just announced that they will be introducing a [new service which will allow you to pay 50p extra to jump to the front of the queue](http://www.engadget.com/2014/08/15/ee-lets-queue-jumpers-pay-50p-for-faster-customer-service/) when you dial their customer support line.

### What is the justification for this?
Before I dive into why this is quite possibly one of the worst ideas that I have heard recently lets look at why EE are doing this.  Their justification is that the additional charge will allow them to open more customer service lines which in turn will improve customer services.

### That makes sense I generaly call customer services because I enjoy it so much
You don't though do you?  We generally call customer services for the following reasons:

* To report a problem with a service we are already paying for
* To change a service because we either no longer require it or are disastisfied with it
* To buy more of the product by adding additional features

### Value vs Failure driven demand
It seems that EE are medicating a problem rather than treating the root cause, this is know in the agile world as *Failure Demand*.

#### Failure Demand
"Failure demand is the demand on the resources of an organisation caused by its own failures.  Support calls, are almost allways failure demand"

#### Value Demand
"The primary demand on your organisation should be value demand.  This demand can be in the form of requests for work that will add value from a customer's perspective"

##### Mary Poppendieck; Tom Poppendieck - Leading Lean Software Development: Results Are Not The Point 2009

If more companies examine themselves in this way and remove the need for their customers to complain and focus on *Value Demand* they will most certainly have happier customers and most likely show increased profit.  

### Makes sense does it not?
In the majority of cases it seems not, big business can learn a lot from startup culture, put the people responsible for creating the problems in front of the customer so that they can understand the impact of their mistakes and so they can understand how they can best fix them.  It seems some organisations would much rather take a reactionary approach, concentrating on the efficiency of customer service lines rather than dealing with the reason that customer service exits in the first place.  If you start with the goal of eradicating customer complaints by following a quality focused development model then the remainder of your calls will be value based which instead of being a cost will help generate profit.
