First and foremost I love technology, I've written some bad code, some very bad code and some downright appaling code.  These days I like to think I'm not so bad, I'm happy to evangalise what I think is the right way to write code and that way always involves TDD and BDD and Agile.  

Currently working at [notonthehighstreet.com](http://notonthehighstreet.com) as a Software Engineering Evangelist, creating software the right way.
