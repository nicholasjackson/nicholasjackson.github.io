First and foremost I love technology, I've written some bad code, some very bad code and some downright appaling code.  These days I like to think I'm not so bad, I'm happy to evangalise what I think is the right way to write code and that way always involves TDD and BDD and Agile.  

Currently working at Marks and Spencer as a Software Engineering Manager I am proud to be working for a company who is hell bent on creating software the right way.  My current team is the best I have ever worked with and when they are not mucking about shooting each other with Nerf guns they are a pretty epic bunch of code monkeys.
